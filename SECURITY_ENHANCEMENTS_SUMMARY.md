- Parameter counting and metadata

**Usage:**
```python
@audit_log(
    event_type=AuditEventType.DATA_CREATE,
    severity=SeverityLevel.MEDIUM,
    resource="medical_report",
    action="create"
)
def create_report(user_id, report_data):
    # Function implementation
    pass
```

### 6. Admin Audit API Endpoints

**Implementation:**
